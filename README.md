# InventaryExercice
We are required to implement, using the eventstore, a basic system with the follwing requirements:

1.	A salesman can save the achieved sales with an ID, product name, quantity, price.
2.	An inventory manager can see the list of product’s names and quantities sold.
3.	A director can see the total amount of sales. 

    Let’s be sure that the results are updated automatically each time a sale is made.
